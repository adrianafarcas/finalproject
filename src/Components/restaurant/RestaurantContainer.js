          <span>Dear friends, </span><br /> <br />
          visit our bouquet restaurant and enjoy the Mediterranean ambience of
          the large, flower-decorated sun terrace. <br />
           Let yourself be spoiled by many homemade dishes, from the traditional Strau√üwirtschaft kitchen to
          the specialties from the Free State of Flaschenhals.
          Enjoy the wines from our own production with their different
          characters, the different grape varieties and locations. <br /> <br />
          <span>We are looking forward to your visit!</span>
        </p>
